#labels Deprecated,Phase-Design
Nearest target for the program:
 * finish all edit/load/view program operations (it means having complete syntax and program representation design)
 * finish working with "program" component - all the code that is required as is seen currently
 * keep interpreter as a mock
 * have the application looks like final (menu, title, toolbars, primary views) for implemented functionality, remove all unused items
